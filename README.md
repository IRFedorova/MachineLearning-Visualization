Loan Prediction Project 

Process: 

Situation Analysis

Data Source: 
Kaggle, the home of Data Science

Objective of Machine Learning Model
The goal for this project is to predict which of the customers will have their loan paid or not. 
Therefore, this is a supervised classification problem to be trained with algorithms like:
